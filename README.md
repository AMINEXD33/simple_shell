# Shell Project - Learning Objectives


## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

1. **Origins of Unix**: Understand who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system and its historical significance.

2. **UNIX Shell**: Recognize the authorship of the first version of the UNIX shell and its role in interacting with the operating system.

3. **B Programming Language**: Learn about the B programming language, the precursor to the C programming language, and its creator.

4. **Ken Thompson**: Gain knowledge about Ken Thompson, a legendary computer scientist, and his contributions to Unix and programming languages.

5. **How a Shell Works**: Understand the fundamental concepts of how a shell works, including its role in processing commands and managing processes.

6. **PID and PPID**: Explore the concepts of PID (Process ID) and PPID (Parent Process ID) and their significance in process management.

7. **Environment Manipulation**: Learn how to manipulate the environment of the current process, including managing environment variables.

8. **Function vs. System Call**: Distinguish between functions and system calls and understand their respective purposes.

9. **Process Creation**: Discover how to create processes in Unix-based systems, including the fork() system call.

10. **Main Prototypes**: Familiarize yourself with the three prototypes of the main function used in C programming.

11. **PATH Variable**: Understand how the shell uses the PATH environment variable to locate executable programs.

12. **Execve System Call**: Learn how to execute another program within a process using the execve system call.

13. **Process Synchronization**: Explore the concept of process synchronization and how to suspend process execution until a child process terminates.

14. **EOF (End-of-File)**: Define EOF and understand its role in input/output operations in Unix.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

- You are responsible for solving the project tasks independently, avoiding plagiarism or unauthorized copying.

- Publishing any content of this project, including code, is strictly prohibited.

- Plagiarism will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### General

- You may use editors such as vi, vim, or emacs to write your code.

- All code files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.

- Each code file should end with a new line.

- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.

- Your code should adhere to the Betty style, and it will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.

- Ensure there are no memory leaks in your shell program.

- Limit the number of functions in a single file to no more than 5.

- Use include guards for all header files.

- Utilize system calls only when necessary and justify their use.

- Write a detailed README that describes your project.

- Create an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository to list all contributors to the repository (following a specified format).

By meeting these requirements, you will demonstrate your understanding of shell programming and best practices in Unix-based development.
